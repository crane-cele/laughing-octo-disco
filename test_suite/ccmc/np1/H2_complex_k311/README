    Fix for >2 k-points in a direction. HF energy in HANDE now correct.


-------
CCSD energy from pyscf will differ to that from HANDE as a different exchange integral treatment is used.
System is H2 in STO-3G in a box size 10.0 bohr with bond length 4.0 bohr and k.e. cutoff 50 Ry.

generated with wrapper script "python ../HH_molcryst_new.py H STO-3G 50 3 1 1 1 10 4.0 4.1 .8"

See hh_311_k50.scf.output for its output.
