( Correlation energy (from HANDE FCI) is -0.176123766865 )
( Do not follow this as an example: the timestep is deliberately too large so to have sufficiently )
( large blooms in order to trigger tau_search. Even after the timestep is rescaled, it is still )
( too large for a sane production calculation )
