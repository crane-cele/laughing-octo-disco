hubbard_fciqmc
==============

Hubbard FCIQMC code by James Spencer, with contributions from Joseph Weston.

User-level documentation detailing the hubbard_fciqmc program is in the documentation/users_guide directory.  Notes from the research meetings are in the documentation/research_meetings directory.  Both are written in reStructuredText (http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) and can be compiled in HTML/PDF/etc using sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org).  Developer-level documentation extracted from directly from the code is also included.

A makefile (documentation/Makefile) is provided for running sphinx on the documentation source files; the output is placed in documentation/build.  The prerequisites for building the documentation are: sphinx, LaTeX, dvipng, doxygen and breathe (https://github.com/michaeljones/breathe).  Note that the breathe path must be on your PYTHONPATH.  Built documentation is placed in the appropriate subdirectory of documentation/build.

Documentation detailing the theory behind the program as well as current and potential future research directions is contained in the documentation/theory directory.  Theory documentation is written in LaTeX.
