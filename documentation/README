HANDE QMC: High Accuracy N-DEterminant Quantum Monte Carlo.
===========================================================

User-level documentation detailing the HANDE program is in the `documentation/users_guide`
directory, written in reStructuredText (http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) and can
be compiled into HTML/LaTeX/PDF/etc using sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org).

A makefile (`documentation/Makefile`) is provided for running sphinx on the documentation
source files; the output is placed in the appropriate subdirectory of `documentation/build`
(e.g. `documentation/build/html` for the HTML version).  Run

    make help

to see the full list of available formats sphinx can produce.  Of course, the
reStructuredText is very readable in its own right.

Documentation detailing the theory behind the program as well as current and potential
future research directions is contained in the documentation/theory directory.
Theory documentation is written in LaTeX.

NOTE:

The HTML documentation uses MathJax (http://www.mathjax.org) to display maths.  By default
we use the javascript files from the MathJax CDN, which requires a working network connection.
If you wish to have the HTML documentation available offline

    git clone https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax
    make clean html

The location of MathJax can be customised by altering the `mathjax_path` variable in the
sphinx config file (`documentation/.sphinx/conf.py`) or by setting the MATHJAX_PATH
environment variable.  MathJax is not included by default as it and the necessary fonts
are rather large.
