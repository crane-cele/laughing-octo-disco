Progress
--------

* Mendeley groups for FCIQMC research and for MSci reading lists have been created.  The MSci reading list is populated with a minimal list of articles.
* James has started the Sign problem paper and it is progressing nicely.  The theory sections are all done.  Introduction, 1D Hubbard model, conclusions, bibliography and figures still need to be done.

Discussion
----------

* Sign problem paper
    + Matthew pointed out that equation 22 is incorrect.
    + Matthew requested more information about randomly selecting spawning events, as he felt this was one of the more subtle points of the method.
    + Introduction
        - can be brief
        - FCIQMC is new but will clearly become increasingly important with time.
        - Achieves FCI accuracy on systems previously inaccessible. 
        - Important to understand how it works in order to be able to improve it.
        - Why is N2 easy but CH4 so hard?!  Clearly not a problem related to strong correlation.
* Discussion on population dynamics---is it possible to consider systems other than a 1x1 matrix?  Matthew briefly tried before we concluded that his email 09/02/11 on the matter was correct (ie it's not).
* Continuous-time algorithm: brief discussion on whether it's possible to use model rates which are smaller than the actual rate.  Matthew would like to see a proof before believing it!  Matthew suggested reading about n-fold way, which is the continuous-time approach in Kinetic Monte Carlo.

Todo
----

* Continue work on sign problem paper.
* See todo list from 27th May 2011.
