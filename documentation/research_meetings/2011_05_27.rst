Progress
--------

* Hampered by external factors!

Discussion
----------

* UEG continuous time might be very hard/impossible.
* What about doing real time evolution for a UROP/MSci project?  If possible, then it would lead to interesting things, such as the spectral function.  Mathematically it seems relatively straightforward, but we need to check whether linear quantities (and only linear quantities) can be correctly accumulated in a memory-efficient manner.
* What about multiplying all determinants by a Jastrow factor?  This is a bit different from the normal case in DMC, where it introduces explicit correlation, as we are working in a discrete basis.  Evaluating the matrix elements might be hard/impossible.  (Post-meeting: James wondered whether the set of Slater-Jastrow functions would span the same space and if it was a problem if they didn't.)
* Importance sampling: choosing a good trial wavefunction remains hard.

See previous notes, sadly!
