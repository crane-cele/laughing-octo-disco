=============

Progress
--------

* Storing determinants as separate alpha and beta strings is now coded and works for small tests, but appears to be buggy when run in parallel.
* Forms for UROP students have been submitted.  Nick and Will will be seated in the Whiteley Suite (not ideal, but the only option).

Discussion
----------

* We resolved to submit two (short) papers by the summer:

  #. Continuous time algorithm.

     This will be a short technical paper containing our formulation of FCIQMC, the continuous time algorithm and some benchmark calculations indicating the benefits.  We also will need to include some views on the use of the ct algorithm.  Whilst it is clear it is unlikely to be useful in real systems, it is likely to be useful for model systems where the sum over the off-diagonal matrix elements can be easily (preferably analytically) evaluated, at least to a good approximation.  The Hubbard model is not a particularly good system for FCIQMC.  Based upon results presented in talks by Ali Alavi, we know that FCIQMC calculations on the UEG work very well and the UEG is well-suited (we think) to the continuous time algorithm.  It would be nice to implement and test this for inclusion in the paper, if possible.

  #. Sign problem.

     This will be a short, mainly theoretical paper, covering our understanding of the sign problem in FCIQMC.  It is important to emphasise that it is **not** related to the the degeneracy of the :math:`\pm\Psi` solutions (as has been stated in the past by the Alavi group; we need to check if this statement has also been published).  Simulations on the Hubbard model comparing the separate string approach to the :math:`\alpha` and :math:`\beta` orbitals will (if we're correct!) demonstrate this.  The population dynamics work should also be included as it follows on neatly from stating the nature of the sign problem.

* Our work on the sign problem is no longer a secret, so it would be good to wrap this up in the near future.
* Matthew had a discussion with James Annett, who mentioned the 1D orbitals ordering approach might be Jordan--Wigner transformation.  A brief look indicates some similarities (ie transformation between bases to make a system easier to solve) but nothing of immediate use.
* In addition, it would be nice to continue work on Hellman-Feynmann sampling and excited states via the folded spectrum approach.
* We discussed the difference between the 1D Hubbard model (where electrons of opposite spin can move past each other) and the 1D UEG and other, more realistic systems (where electrons cannot do this due to essentially :math:`U \rightarrow \infty` as :math:`r \rightarrow 0`).

Todo
----

#. Continuous time
    * Continue optimisation of continuous time code.
    * UEG implementation.
    * Benchmark studies.
#. Sign problem
    * Debug separate strings code. 
    * 1D tests.
    * 2D?  Obviously the approach won't work perfectly in 2D (as one cannot control all off-diagonal elements) but hopefully it will reduce the plateau substantially.
#. Students
    * Select reading material for MSci students.  We should meet with them after their exams but before the end of term.
    * Improve code documentation for incoming UROP students.
