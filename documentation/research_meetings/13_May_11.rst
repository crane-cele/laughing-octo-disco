============

Progress
--------

* Bug in the separate strings code fixed.
* Doc branch created and user documentation improved.  In principle existing comments in the code could be easily transformed into doxygen format and included with the sphinx output.
* Progress has been made on continuous time optimisation, though there is still some work to do.

Discussion
----------

* We started discussing model rates for a continuous time UEG implementation.  This quickly turned into a discussion on how using model rates actually worked, which revealed we didn't know how to put what we'd done into a mathematical framework, even for the Hubbard model.  Clearly we need to be able to understand this before we can figure out the approach to use for the UEG.

Todo
----

* See list from 6th May.
* Formulation of the continuous time algorithm with model rates.
