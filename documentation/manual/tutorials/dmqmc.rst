Density Matrix Quantum Monte Carlo
==================================

In this tutorial we will run DMQMC on the 36-site 2D Heisenberg model with :math:`J=1`
with zero magnetic field. The input and output files can be found under the ``documentation/manual/tutorials/calcs/dmqmc``
subdirectory of the source distribution.  Knowledge of the terminology and theory given in
[Booth09]_, [Blunt14]_ and [Malone15]_ is assumed.

To begin we set up the system
