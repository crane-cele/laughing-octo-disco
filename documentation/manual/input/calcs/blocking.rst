.. _blocking_table:

blocking options
================

The ``blocking`` table contains options used to control the options for performing
blocking analysis on the fly.

``blocking_on_the_fly``
    type: boolean.

    Optional. Default: false

    If true, the data for blocking analysis is collected every report loop and blocking
    analysis is performed on the fly while the calculation is running.

``start_save_frequency``
    type: integer.

    Optional. Default: -1

    Log2 of the frequency at which the potential start points of the blocking analysis is
    saved. When negative, the frequency is the nearest integer to the log2(``nreports``) - 8.

``start_point_number``
    type: integer.

    Optional. Default: -1

    Number of potential start points of the blocking analysis that is to be saved. If
    negative, the integer part of ``nreports``/2^(``start_save_frequency``).

``filename``
    type: string.

    Optional. Default: 'BLOCKING'

    Filename to which the blocking analysis report is written.

``start_point``
    type: integer.

    Optional. Default: -1

    The iteration number from which the data for blocking analysis is collected. When
    negative the data is collected when ``target_population`` is reached.
