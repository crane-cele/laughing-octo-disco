The subdirectories here contain various (old) notes on theoretical issues for interest,
which are occasionally (rarely) updated.  These were mainly an attempt to understand
things ourselves, but may be of general interest.


Subsequent papers (or soon-to-appear) papers may contain better (or different)
explanations!  Caveat emptor.
