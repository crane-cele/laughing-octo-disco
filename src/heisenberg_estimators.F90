        ! so can then deduce the number where the 1 is on sublattice 2.

        ! There are three contributions to add to the projected energy from
        ! the current basis function. Consider the Neel singlet state:
        ! |NS> = \sum_{i} a_i|D_i>
        ! The amplitudes, a_i, only depend on the number of spins up on sublattice 1.
        ! We want to calculate \sum_{i} (a_i * <D_i|H|D_j> * n_j), where |D_j> is the
        ! current basis function, and then add this to the current projected energy.

        ! Firstly, consider the diagonal term:
        ! We have <D_j|H|D_j> stored, so this is simple:
        hmatel%r = wfn_dat(n) * cdet%data(1)

        ! Now consider off-diagonal contributions, |D_i> /= |D_j>.
        ! To create a connected |D_i> from |D_j>, simply find a pair of anti-parallel
        ! spins in |D_j> (a 0-1 bond) and flip both of these spins. Following this
        ! procedure for every pair of anti-parallel spins generates *all* connected
        ! |D_i>'s, and hence every term which needs to be considered for the following.
        ! Now, the amplitude a_i only depends on the number of spins up on sublattice 1.
        ! This will depend on whether, for the 0-1 bond flipped, the 1 (up spin) was one
        ! sublattice 1 or 2. If the up spin was on lattice 1, there will be one less up
        ! spin on sublattice 1 after the flip. If it was on sublattice 2, there will be
        ! one extra spin. So we can have either of the two amplitudes, neel_singlet_amp(n-1)
        ! or neel_singlet_amp(n+1) respectively, where neel_singlet_amp == wfn_dat. We just
        ! need to know how many of each type of 0-1 bonds there are. But we have these
        ! already - they are stored as lattice_1_up and lattice_2_up. Finally note that the
        ! matrix element is -J/2, and we can put this together...

        ! From 0-1 bonds where the 1 is on sublattice 1, we have:
        hmatel%r = hmatel%r - (sys%heisenberg%J * lattice_1_up * wfn_dat(n-1))/2

        ! And from 1-0 bond where the 1 is on sublattice 2, we have:
        hmatel%r = hmatel%r - (sys%heisenberg%J * lattice_2_up * wfn_dat(n+1))/2

        estimators%proj_energy = estimators%proj_energy + hmatel%r * pop(1)

        ! Now we just need to find the contribution to the denominator. The total
        ! denominator is
        ! \sum_{i} (a_i * n_i)
        ! Hence from this particular basis function, |D_j>, we just add (a_j * n_j)
