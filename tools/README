HANDE (and related) tools
=========================

[todo] - summary of what each tool does

pyblock
    blocking analysis module in python.  Very flexible and used extensively in the main
    analysis tools.  pyblock is maintained at https://github.com/jsspencer/pyblock and is
    incorporated into the HANDE repository using git-subtree (available in git 1.7.11
    onwards though usually has to be installed separately).  To get additional changes
    from upstream use:

        $ git remote add st/pyblock git@github.com:jsspencer/pyblock.git
        $ git subtree pull --prefix=tools/pyblock st/pyblock master

    git-subtree can similarly be used to send changes upstream.  Note that as pyblock was
    incorporated without using --squash, do *not* using --squash to retrieve subsequent
    updates---bad things and conflicts seem to happen if you do!
