lib/ contains source code that is not tied to the meta-ueg project.

lib/dSFMT
    double-precision SIMD-oriented Fast Mersenne Twister (dSFMT).
    downladed from http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/SFMT/index.html.
lib/external
    interfaces to other libraries; publicly available routines.
    note: pslaprnt and pdlaprnt from the NETLIB SCALAPACK distribution are included.  This is because the versions in some versions of MKL are buggy, so we supply functioning routines instead.  These routines are not performance critical.
lib/local
    locally written library routines.
