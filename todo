1.  option to obtain eigenvalues (default) or eigenvectors as well.
2.  timing.
3.  memory logging.
4.  checktest.
5.  block diagonalise hamiltonian matrix for k inversion and spin inversion.
6.  parallel direct lanczos.
7.  UEG.
8.  Improve selection of calculation: bit string variable rather than many logic flags.
9.  Better name?

FCIQMC
------

a) quicksort (see iterative implementation in OMP library---compare to that of NR?)
b) blocking script
c) binary search
d) restart

FCIQMC parallelisation
----------------------

Have scrapped the idea of hybrid OpenMP-MPI parallelisation: there are no
memory benefits for the hubbard code and NECI can be tackled using mmap.

a) Hashing to distribute walkers.
b) Parallel sort.
c) Update shift and projected energy.
