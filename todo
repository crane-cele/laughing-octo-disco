1.  option to obtain eigenvalues (default) or eigenvectors as well.
2.  timing
3.  memory logging
4.  document
5.  checktest
6.  block diagonalise hamiltonian matrix for k inversion and spin inversion.
7.  parallel direct lanczos.
8.  UEG.
9.  FCIQMC.

FCIQMC
------

Test more efficient (but currently wrong) FCIQMC procedures with simple_fciqmc.

a) Use stochastic_death rather than simple_death
b) Use excitation generators to spawn
c) Change shift update function

OpenMP plan
-----------

a) Use local states for RNG.
b) Test OpenMP with orphaned routines.
c) Implement pragmas in spawning and death.  Use one thread for sorting.
d) Threaded sort.

Hybrid parallelisation
----------------------

a) OpenMP.
b) Hashing to distribute walkers.
c) Parallel sort.
