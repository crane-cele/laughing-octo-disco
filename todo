1.  option to obtain eigenvalues (default) or eigenvectors as well.
2.  timing.
3.  memory logging.
4.  checktest.
5.  parallel direct lanczos.
6.  UEG.
7.  Better name? A: High-Accuracy N-DImensional Quantum Monte Carlo (HANDIQMC)

FCIQMC
------

1. HPHF type work

Hellmann--Feynmann
------------------

1. Variables to refer to pop, hfpop etc in main lists.
   Possibility to expand pop lists.
2. Changes to annihilation. NOT DONE FOR i-FCIQMC.
3. Changes to restart.
4. fciqmc routine.
5. test with hamiltonian operator.
6. test with kinetic energy.
7. w/ initiator?

Quantities to accumulate:

* O_{0j] c_j
* H_{0j} \tilde{c}_j
* H_{0j} c_j
* c_0
* \tilde{c}_0

FCIQMC parallelisation
----------------------

1. Investigate load-balancing issues.

Optimisations
-------------

1. sym_table in terms of basis functions

Cleanup
-------

1. system specific modules: spawning, hamiltonian matrix elements
