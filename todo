1.  option to obtain eigenvalues (default) or eigenvectors as well.
2.  timing
3.  memory logging
4.  checktest
5.  block diagonalise hamiltonian matrix for k inversion and spin inversion.
6.  parallel direct lanczos.
7.  UEG.
8.  Mixed precision.
9.  Compile time selection of bit string length.
10. Improve selection of calculation: bit string store.

FCIQMC
------

a) quicksort
b) blocking script

FCIQMC parallelisation
----------------------

Have scrapped the idea of hybrid OpenMP-MPI parallelisation: there are no
memory benefits for the hubbard code and NECI can be tackled using mmap.

a) Hashing to distribute walkers.
b) Parallel sort.
c) Update shift and projected energy.
